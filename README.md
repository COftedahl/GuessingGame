# GuessingGame
Guess a number between 1 and 100 in 7 guesses; loops game after finishing. Testing using streams to convert I/O methods. 

To run, call run() from SampleGuessingGameReworked, passing in @param an AbstractStreamManager produced by the StreamFactory class. Standard stream type = Sys.in, Sys.out -> terminal; Custom stream type = javax.swing input/output; alternatively can use I/O stream from files and ByteInputStreams using the StreamFactory class to appropriately handle them.
